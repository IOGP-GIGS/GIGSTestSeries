GIGS is an open-source digital testing framework designed to evaluate the capability of software in establishing and maintaining the integrity of geospatial data. It is primarily aimed at geoscience applications, but elements can be readily applied to any software that handles spatial data. The testing framework comprises a series of qualitative evaluations that assess software functionality and configuration, coupled with data-driven tests that quantify the accuracy and robustness of geodetic engines and libraries, in executing coordinate operations.

The GIGS Test Series provides a qualitative checklist framework for software development good practice for geospatial applications. The GIGS Test Series is grouped into numbered themes that pertain to different aspects of software functionality and capability, as defined below. IOGP Guidance Note 430-1 covers the background of the themes in more detail. Within each Test Series several tests are presented - typically between 10 and 20 individual tests per series. These tests refer to a specific element of functionality or capability being evaluated. Associated with every test are several response criteria that correspond with a GIGS Level. For each relevant test, the Evaluator should select the criterion that describes the conditions most closely aligned with the application being tested. In some cases, a test may be associated with a Test Procedure utilising the Test Dataset. Tests are numbered sequentially and, where relevant, sub-numbered if multiple tests pertain to one particular piece of functionality
